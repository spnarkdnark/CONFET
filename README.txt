using javascript and the HTML canvas to build on the confetti feature of TOO-DA.  I will use the existing script and its
Piece() class to make subclasses for three different shapes: the square, the rectangle, and the circle.  Further development
will look at the triangle, but right now i don't want to figure out the geometry.  I will use simple HTML input methods such
as text, radio buttons and range sliders to determine the size, color, gravity and type of shapes to be used in the
confetti march.
